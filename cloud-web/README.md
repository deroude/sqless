# SQLess

## Pitch

Hi, I'm Jack.

I'm a web and mobile app developer.
I write Angular, React, React Native, Ionic -- and I'm a rockstar in all of these.

What I don't like is writing backend.

It's always the same. Authentication, authorization, layer upon layer of interfaces, business logic, data access, ORM, DB maintenance, indexes, transactions.

So, I've been Googling zero backend platforms. Like Firebase.
They're nice. But they're non-standard (vendor specific), limited functionality, hard to maintain and no-frigging-sql.

Sure, they're good enough for a blog, but for an accounting app, I need relations.

Enter Codemancy SQLess.

Now all I have to do is:

- Write my web app -- which is what I do for a living
- Write an OAS 3 API specification (yaml or json) -- which I would do anyway
- Put these 2 on Github
- Connect my repo to Codemancy SQLess

That's it. Those guys will automatically hook my OAS 3 spec to a Postgres DB and serve the API exactly as I need it.

And you know what's the best thing? It's not just dumb CRUD. There is no limit to the complexity of operations I can get them to perform on the DB.
